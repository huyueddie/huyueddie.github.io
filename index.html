This project will assess flood risks to homes in the Boston area due to sea level rise and storm surge. The project will visualize
the number of residential properties, value of residential properties, and fraction of housing stock at risk to 0, 9, 21, and 36 inches of sea level rise.
Data for residential real estate is from Zillow and the City of Bostonâ€™s assessors data. Data for flooding is from FEMA and the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model.
